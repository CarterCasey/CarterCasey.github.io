<h1>HTTP/2 - Guest lecture with Mark Nottingham</h1>

<ul>
<li>The Web works differently now:
<ul>
<li>The amount of content transferred for a page has grown.</li>
<li>The number of request/response cycles has increased considerably.</li>
<li>This causes a lot of latency.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>We have new performance techniques to deal with this.
<ul>
<li>CSS spriting (lots of little images in one).</li>
<li>Inlining images into CSS to avoid extra loads.</li>
<li>Sharding - spread resources out onto separate domains.</li>
<li>Concatenation - stick all the data into one resource to force only one request.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>These are hacks - they're a response to what seems to be a broken protocol.</li>
<li>"Eliminate requests." - but why are requests so bad.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why are HTTP requests so expensive?</h2>

<ol>
<li>HTTP/1 uses TCP poorly
<ul>
<li>Head of Line Blocking: Have one outstanding request per connection.</li>
<li>So we try to use multiple (4-8) connections per page load.</li>
<li>This makes HTTP "short and bursty," while TCP wants long-standing connections.</li>
<li>Don't want to overload link with congestion, so we can't use tons of connections.</li>
<li>On the other hand, most of the HTTP requests live in slow start.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>HTTP Headers have gotten really big
<ul>
<li>Multiple requests to the same server often means lots of redundant bytes.</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>

<h2>How does HTTP/2 address this?</h2>

<p>The main, underlying goal, is to use <strong>one</strong> TCP connection efficiently.  </p>

<h3>Frames</h3>

<ul>
<li>Request/response is parsed (usually) into header and 0 or more data frames</li>
<li>Multiplexing - reordering is allowed, based on stream ID.
<ul>
<li>Allows requests to go out all at once.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<h4>Prioritization and Flow Control</h4>

<ul>
<li>Help clients and servers better communicate about the data they send back and forth.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Header Compression</h3>

<ul>
<li>The character re-use in headers makes compressing them over multiple requests very powerful.</li>
<li>CRIME: Allows an injection attack to break open encrypted GZIP packets.</li>
<li>Instead, they use HPACK. There's a coarser granularity, which makes probing much harder.</li>
<li>HPACK isn't quite as powerful compression as GZIP, but close enough and safer.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Server Push</h3>

<ul>
<li>The server <em>knows</em> what most of your next requests are going to be.</li>
<li>HTTP/2 lets the server push you the information it knows you're going to want.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Adoption of SPDY</h2>

<ul>
<li>IETF picked SPDY as the successor from the start - they saw how well it was doing, wanted to take over and make it public, instead of leaving it out on the market.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Questions</h2>

<p>Q. What's the future of the Web in terms of the transport layer, especially considering how HTTP/2 takes on some of the jobs that are typically relegated to the transport layer?  </p>

<p>A. The writing's on the wall for TCP.  </p>

<ul>
<li>Multiple Proposals:
<ul>
<li>SPUD - standardize headers for UDP.</li>
<li>QUIC - Google's experiment of HTTP/2 on UDP. Encryption baked in. FEC. Super-fancy.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
