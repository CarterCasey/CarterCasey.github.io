	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>My name is Carter Casey, and I'm a senior at Tufts University. I'll be graduating this May with a Bachelors in Science for my two majors: Cognitive and Brain Science, and Computer Science.</p>

	<p>I came late to Computer Science, discovering well into my first major that I loved working with code. In my second and third semesters doing Comp Sci, I TA'd the first and second introductory courses: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/11">Introduction to Computer Science</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/15">Data Structures</a>.</p>

	<p>This past semester I had the honor of being named Teaching Fellow for a course regarded as one of our most work intensive, but also most rewarding: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40">Machine Architecture and Assembly Language Programming</a>. I was responsible for coordinating the other TAs, as well as leading supplementary lessons for the students around exam time. I didn't continue in that position for the Spring. I'm trying to fit a lot into my last semester as an undergrad at Tufts, so I couldn't continue my responsibilities as Teaching Fellow. I'm still a teaching assistant, though, helping out with <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/170">Computation Theory</a> while working through my courseload.</p>

	<p>I'm currently enrolled in four CS courses at Tufts: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/181">Compilers</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20">Web Programming</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/112">Networks &amp; Protocols</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150IDS">Inernet-Scale Distributed Systems: Lessons from the World Wide Web</a> (by far the longest name of a course I've taken here).</p>
