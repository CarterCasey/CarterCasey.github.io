	<h1>About Me</h1>

	<p>My name is Carter Casey, and I'm a graduate of Tufts University, where I earned a B.S. in Cognitive &amp; Brain Sciences and Computer Science. Over the summer I'm working as a Software Development Intern for <a href="http://www.athenahealth.com/">athenahealth</a> in Watertown, MA.</p>

	<p>This fall (2015) I'll be going back to Tufts to get a Masters in Computer Science.</p>

	<p>I came late to Computer Science, discovering four semesters into my first major that I loved working with code. In my second and third semesters doing Comp Sci, I TA'd the first and second introductory courses: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/11">Introduction to Computer Science</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/15">Data Structures</a>.</p>

	<p>During the fall semester of senior year I had the honor of being named Teaching Fellow for a course regarded as one of our most work intensive, but also most rewarding: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/40">Machine Architecture and Assembly Language Programming</a>. I was responsible for coordinating the other TAs and leading supplementary lessons for the students around exam time. I managed to fit a lot of classes into my last semester as an undergrad at Tufts, but I couldn't continue my responsibilities as Teaching Fellow. I still worked as a teaching assistant, helping out with <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/170">Computation Theory</a> while working through my courseload.</p>

	<p>This past semester I was enrolled in four CS courses at Tufts: <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/181">Compilers</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/20">Web Programming</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/112">Networks &amp; Protocols</a>, and <a href="http://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150IDS">Inernet-Scale Distributed Systems: Lessons from the World Wide Web</a> (by far the longest name of a course I've taken here).</p>
